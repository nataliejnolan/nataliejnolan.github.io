<p>
    <div class="a">Impractical Jokers is an American television show about four best friends, Joe Gatto, Sal Vulcano, Brian Quinn, <br> and James Murray, who dare each other to prank and perform embarrassing tasks in public. The show revolves <br> around hidden-camera scenarios where each member takes turns performing embarrassing tasks, as directed by <br> the other guys through an earpiece. If they refuse or fail to perform a task they lose, making it high stakes to do any <br> and everything asked. The show is known for the chemistry between the friends, the improvisation, as well as the <br> lighthearted humor of the pranks. Impractical Jokers is currently on their 11th season, with the first season premiering <br> in 2011 and having been an American comedy fan-favorite ever since.

    <div class="a">Each task that they compete in is called a challenge. There are various challenges that they compete in throughout the seasons. <br> Some favorites are:
    </div>
        <ol>
        <li> <u><b>The Try Not To Laugh Challenge</b></u> → Where all four members are in a waiting room, doing crazy things to try <br> and make each other laugh. Whoever is the last in the waiting room without laughing wins. </li>
        <li><u><b>Focus Group Challenges</b></u> → Where one of the guys will be participating in a focus group doing whatever the <br> other guys say, despite being in a room answering questions with multiple other people. </li>
        <li><u><b>Presentations</b></u> → Occasionally, one or two of the guys will have to give a presentation to an audience <br> without knowing anything about the presentation or even the topic of it. These can be the funniest episodes <br> because it's a surprise to the guys as well as the public. </li>
    </ol>
    An episode typically consists of two or three challenges, having the member who loses the most tasks get punished. <br> A punishment happens at the end of every episode, and the cast member can not back down from whatever <br> it is since it is their punishment.
