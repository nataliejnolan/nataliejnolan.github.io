    Punishments are the biggest part of every episode. At the end of each episode, whoever lost the most challenges <br> must complete a punishment given to them by the other guys. The rule is that you can never say no to a <br> punishment no matter what it is. The punishments range from physical challenges to embarrassing tasks to <br> psychological games. The total amount of punishments per jokers is:</div>

    Some of the best punishments on the show are:
    <ul style="color:darkslateblue">
        <li><u><b>The Tattoo Punishment</b></u>→ Joe won this episode, leaving Sal, Murr, and Q to all be punished. Joe had <br>them all get tattoos without being able to see what they were until it was finished.</li>
        <li><u><b>The Marriage Punishment</b></u>→ Sal was being punished this episode and they had him strapped to a two-wheeler <br>while Murr married his younger sister. In the church, they had all of their family and friends <br>to watch the ceremony </li>
        <li><u><b>The Genie Punishment</b></u>→ Joe was being punished this episode and they had him be the Genie in a small play, <br> without knowing his lines or what the play was about. They hooked him up to a harness and made<br> him “fly” crashing into and destroying the set when least expected. </li>
        <li><u><b>The Interview Punishment</b></u>→ Murr was being punished this episode and they made him believe he was going to <br> a weightlifting competition, so they oiled him up and sent him in. Only to find out he was <br>walking into a room where he would have to interview his childhood celebrity crush, Danica McKeller.</li>
        <li><u><b>The Tarantula Punishment</b></u>→ Q was being punished this episode and one of his biggest fears is spiders. They <br>took him to a warehouse and strapped him to a bed where they brought out tarantula spiders <br>and had them crawl on him while strapped down. This punishment was hard to watch because you could see the <br> pain he was in.</li>
    </ul>
