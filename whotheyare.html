<p style="font-size:30px;"><b>How They Met</b></p>
<p>
    <div class="a">All of the guys met as freshmen in high school, at an all boys catholic high school in Staten Island, New York. They <br>quickly bonded over their humor and became very close friends. In their twenties, they created a comedy <br>group called The Tenderloins, where they produced sketch comedy and entered contests. They eventually won a <br>contest with their sketch called The Craig Murray Incident, and won a cash prize which they put towards<br> creating a pilot episode for Impractical Jokers.
